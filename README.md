# Status of Funds App
- Problem: The leadership of the 75th Army Ranger Regiment do not have full access to GFEBS, a database that serves to keep track of their transaction history and budget. 
- Solution: An iOS app that allows those without access to GFEBS to view, but not modify, the transaction history, budget, and their various graphs of the 75th Army Ranger Regiment.
- App Info: The app will permit the user to view the Regimentâ€™s financial data and history from the convenience of their smartphone. The user groups are those who can view the data, and those who can view and upload more data. <br /><br />
